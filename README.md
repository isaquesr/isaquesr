### Hi there 👋

My name is Isaque Souza from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as Back-end since 2010 and currently I'm Tech Lead at [Via Varejo](https://www.viavarejo.com.br/). I've always loved to produce a lot of content during my career.

In my free time I like to play (and watch) soccer (⚽️), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵) and eventually I like to philosophize about life with a beer (🍺).

Would you like to find me?
